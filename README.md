blueMAGIC: Marine Analysis for metaGenomic Identification of bioactive microbial Compounds

Marine bacteria are attractive for applications in biotechnology, like biosynthesis of enzymes, bioremediation, drug development, and sustainable alternatives to antibiotics. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health challenge that threatens the effectiveness of antibiotics. Misuse and overuse of antibiotics have led to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, making it increasingly difficult to treat infections. 

To combat this growing threat, finding alternatives to antibiotics is crucial. Natural sources of antimicrobial agents, such as marine environments, offer a promising avenue for the discovery of new compounds that can provide effective alternatives to conventional antibiotics. 

Despite increased interest, very little effort has been made to systematically survey secondary metabolites and phages in marine ecosystems, with most research focused on smaller regional data sets. Hence, more research should be done to investigate marine microbial hotspots for discovering secondary metabolites and other antibacterial agents. Such research could direct other researchers and stakeholders, like industry, to a more focused investigation of microbial bioactive compounds.

In this Github repository all code will be presented in the best way to increase FAIRness of the research.

## Bioinformatics
